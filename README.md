# centaurscience
The start of a super cool active search app

# Run simple

If you want to you can run pieces of this application on its own. Pieces that support being run without docker compose are:
  - backend
  - frontend (Not super helpful though)

# Run docker

If you don't have docker/docker-compose all set up on your computer head on over to their docs. Otherwise, run "docker-compose up", and you're all set to access the site at localhost:4000.
